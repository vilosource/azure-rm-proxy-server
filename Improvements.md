# Recommended Improvements for Azure RM Proxy Server

This document is a recommendation for improving the server, I will implement these in the next sprint.


## 1. Refactor `AzureResourceService` to Improve SRP

**Goal:** Reduce the number of responsibilities in the `AzureResourceService` class by extracting cross-cutting concerns like authentication and caching.

**Steps:**

1.  Create new Python files for authentication and caching concerns (e.g., `azure_rm_proxy/core/authentication.py` and `azure_rm_proxy/core/caching_manager.py`).
2.  Move the authentication-related code from `AzureResourceService` to the new `authentication.py` file. Create a class (e.g., `AzureAuthenticator`) to encapsulate this functionality.
3.  Move the caching-related code from `AzureResourceService` to the new `caching_manager.py` file. Create a class (e.g., `CacheManager`) to handle caching logic.
4.  In `AzureResourceService`, create instances of `AzureAuthenticator` and `CacheManager` and delegate the respective tasks to these new objects.
5.  Update any parts of the code that directly accessed authentication or caching logic within `AzureResourceService` to use the new classes instead.
6.  Ensure that the `AzureResourceService` now primarily focuses on orchestrating calls to the mixins and managing the overall request flow.

## 2. Enhance DIP by Introducing Mixin Abstractions

**Goal:** Reduce direct dependencies on concrete mixin implementations by introducing abstractions (interfaces or abstract base classes).

**Steps:**

1.  Create a new Python file for mixin abstractions (e.g., `azure_rm_proxy/core/mixins/abstract_mixins.py`).
2.  Define abstract base classes (using Python's `abc` module) for the different types of mixins (e.g., `BaseResourceMixin`, `AADGroupMixinInterface`, `NetworkMixinInterface`, etc.). These abstract classes should define the methods that each concrete mixin must implement.
3.  Update each concrete mixin class to inherit from its corresponding abstract base class.
4.  In `AzureResourceService`, modify the code to interact with the mixins through their abstract base classes or interfaces, rather than directly instantiating or referencing the concrete mixin classes.
5.  This might involve using a factory pattern or dependency injection to provide the `AzureResourceService` with instances of the concrete mixins via their abstract interfaces.

## 3. Formalize Mixin Interface with Abstract Base Classes

**Goal:** Improve code clarity and ensure consistency across mixins by explicitly defining the methods they should implement.

**Steps:**

1.  (This step is integrated with Step 2). Ensure that the abstract base classes defined in `azure_rm_proxy/core/mixins/abstract_mixins.py` clearly define all the methods that the `AzureResourceService` expects the mixins to have.
2.  Use type hinting in both the abstract base classes and the concrete mixins to further clarify the expected method signatures.

## 4. Detailed Caching Analysis

**Goal:** Understand the specific caching pattern implemented and evaluate its effectiveness.

**Steps:**

1.  Examine the code in `azure_rm_proxy/core/caching/` and related files in detail.
2.  Identify the specific caching pattern being used (e.g., Cache-Aside, Read-Through, Write-Through, etc.).
3.  Analyze how cache keys are generated, how cache expiration is handled, and how cache consistency is maintained.
4.  Evaluate the performance implications of the current caching strategy.
5.  Document the findings of this analysis in a dedicated section within `Improvements.md` or a separate caching design document.

## 5. Review and Standardize Error Handling

**Goal:** Ensure consistent and robust error handling and exception management across the project.

**Steps:**

1.  Review how errors and exceptions are handled in `AzureResourceService`, the mixins, and other relevant parts of the codebase.
2.  Identify any inconsistencies in error handling approaches (e.g., using exceptions in some places and return codes in others).
3.  Establish a standardized error handling strategy (e.g., consistent use of custom exceptions).
4.  Implement the standardized error handling strategy throughout the codebase.
5.  Ensure that errors are logged appropriately and provide meaningful information for debugging.
